## 🧩 What's Inside

This page is built with pure HTML and includes:

- Right-to-left layout for Persian content
- A bold title (`<h1 id="title">`)
- A heartfelt message with time and emphasis (`<p id="description">`)
- A stylized address (`<address id="address">`)
- A final note of importance (`<b id="important-description">`)

No CSS. No JavaScript. Just the essentials.
